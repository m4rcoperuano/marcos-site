        Hello World! This site is primarily built to satisfy my more creative
        side. I like to code, but not always on "work" things. So the goal is to
        use this site to play with new technologies, blog, and just have fun.

            Probably my favorite fullstack framework for the last 7 or 8 years.
            If you have a hobby project or a start up, I cannot recommend
            Laravel enough. The community is fantastic, the code is clean and
            elegant, and it'll teach ya concepts that you can bring to other
            environments. The docs are event a joy to read, which is rare to
            find.

            Vue feels like a natural extension of the web. You can use the same
            old HTML and CSS that you're familiar with, sprinkle in some
            javascript, and you got a reactive application. Initially, I was not
            sold on single page applications. They seemed unnecessary when you
            have good-old server rendered pages. But I've learned to love it
            over time, and now prefer SPA's over traditional server-rendered
            pages any day. All that was thanks to Vue.

            One of my earliest experiences programming was using the .NET framework for web
            applications. Over the years, I've worked with .NET's MVC 3, 4, 5, and now .NET Core.
            I find it a really elegantly designed framework with an intuitive language (C#).
